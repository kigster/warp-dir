      For this gem to work, you must also install the coupled shell function
      into your shell initialization file. The following command should complete the
      setup (but please change '~/.bash_profile' with whatever you use for shell
      initialization, although for most situations ~/.bash_profile is good enough).

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF.bold.green
   warp-dir install --dotfile ~/.bash_profile

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<~EOF
      Restart your shell, and you should now have 'wd' shell function that
      should be used instead of the warp-dir executable.

      Start with:

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF.bold.blue
  $ wd help
  $ wd <directory>  #{'# change directory – works just like "cd"'.bold.black}
  $ wd add <name>   #{'# add current directory as a warp point, call it <name>'.bold.black}
  $ wd<TAB>         #{'# to see the command completion in action'.bold.black}
    EOF
    @install_notice += <<~EOF
