For this gem to work, you must also install the coupled shell function
into your shell initialization file. The following command should complete the
setup (but please change '~/.bash_login' with whatever you use for shell
initialization, although for most situations ~/.bash_login is good enough).

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF.bold.green
  $ warp-dir install --dotfile ~/.bash_login

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF
Restart your shell, and you should now have 'wd' shell function that
should be used instead of the warp-dir executable.

Start with:

    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF.bold.blue
  $ wd help
  $ wd <directory>  # change directory – works just like "cd"
  $ wd add <name>   # add current directory as a warp point, call it <name>
    EOF
    @install_notice += <<-EOF

Please submit issues to:

Thank you!

    INSTALL_NOTICE = @install_notice
  end
end
