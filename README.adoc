This is a ruby implementation of the tool `wd` (warp directory), https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd[originally written as a `ZSH` module] by https://github.com/mfaerevaag[Markus Færevaag].

I personally went back to `bash` after trying out `ZSH`, but it was the `wd` plugin that I really missed.

While Markus kindly offered a ruby version in a https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd/tree/ruby[separate branch of this module],
it wasn't quite as extensible as I wanted to (or well tested), so it ended up being an inspiration for this gem.

== Warp This

WarpDir is a UNIX command line tool that works somewhat similar to the standard built-in command `cd` -- "change directory".

The main difference is that `wd` is able to add/remove/list folder "shortcuts", and allows you to jump to these shortcuts from anywhere on the filesystem.

This of this as a folder-navigation super-charge tool that you'd use on a most frequently-used set of folders. This becomes *really useful* if you are often finding yourself going into a small number of deeply nested folders with a long path prefix.

== Installation

Three steps:

* `wd` requires a Ruby interpreter version 2.2 higher.
 ** Please Check your default ruby with `ruby --version`. You should see something like "ruby 2.3.0p0....".
 ** If you see version 1.9 or earlier, please upgrade your ruby using the package manager native to your OS.
* Install `warp-dir` ruby gem (note: you may need to prefix the command with `sudo` if you are installing into the "system" ruby namespace).
+
[source,bash]
----
$ gem install warp-dir
----

* The last step is to install the `wd` BASH function and auto-completion. This step appends the required shell function to your shell initialization file, that is specified with the `warp-dir install --dotfile <shell-dot-file>` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ warp-dir install --dotfile ~/.bash_profile
Shell support is installed in the following files:
/Users/kig/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
# Now we can use 'wd' shortcut
$ wd --help

# And, it supports command completion in BASH!
$ wd
----

After the last step you *need to restart your session*, so -- if you are on Mac OS X, -- please reopen your Terminal or better yet -- https://www.iterm2.com/[iTerm2], and then type:

[source,bash]
----
$ wd help
----

If the above command returns a properly formatted help that looks like the image below, your setup is now complete!

== Usage

NOTE: in the below examples, the characters `~ ❯ ` denote the current shell prompt, showing the current folder you are in. The command to type is on the right hand side of the "❯".

Let's first bookmark a long directory:

[source,bash]
----
~ ❯ cd ~/workspace/arduino/robots/command-bridge/src
~/workspace/arduino/robots/command-bridge/src ❯ wd add cbsrc
Warp point saved!

~/workspace/arduino/robots/command-bridge/src ❯ cd ~/workspace/c++/foo/src
~/workspace/c++/foo/src ❯ wd add foosrc
Warp point saved!

~/workspace/c++/foo/src ❯ cd /usr/local/Cellar
/usr/local/Cellar ❯ wd add brew
Warp point saved!
----

Now we can list/inspect current set of warp points:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/Cellar ❯ wd l
   cbsrc -> ~/workspace/arduino/robots/command-bridge/src
  foosrc -> ~/workspace/c++/foo/src
    brew -> /usr/local/Cellar
----

Now we can jump around these warp points, as well as run 'ls' inside (even passing arbitrary arguments to the `ls` itself):

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/Cellar ❯ wd cbsrc
~/workspace/arduino/robots/command-bridge/src ❯ wd foosrc
~/workspace/c++/foo/src ❯  1 wd ls brew -- -alF | head -4        # run ls -alF inside /usr/local/Cellar
total 0
drwxrwx---  73 kig  staff  2482 May  7 15:29 ./
drwxrwx---  21 kig  staff   714 Apr 28 11:40 ../
drwxrwx---   3 kig  staff   102 Dec 24 03:14 ack/
----

==== Command Completion

If you installed `wd` properly, it should register it's own command completion for BASH and be ready for your tabs :)

Note that you can use `wd` to change directory by giving an absolute or relative directory name, just like `cd` (so not just using warp-points), so when you type `wd [TAB]` you will see all saved warp points as well as the local directories you can `cd` into.

That's basically it!

==== Config File (aka. Warp Points Database)

All of the mappings are stored in the `~/.warprc` file, where the warp point name is followed by a colon, and the path it maps to. So it's trivial to do a global search/replace on that file in your favorite editor, if, for example, a commond top level folder had changed.

The format of the file was left identical to that of the `ZSH` version of `wd` so that one could switch back and force between the two versions of `wd` and still be able to use their collection of warp points.

See? I think we thought of everything :)

Happy warping!

== `wd` Concept

The overall concept comes from the realization that when we work on the command line, we often do things that `wd` tool provides straight out of the box, such as:

* we often have to deal with a limited number of folders at any given time
* on occastion have to jump between these folders (which we call *warp points*), which may require mult-level `cd` command, for example: `+cd ~/workspace/foo/src/include/; ....; cd ~/Documents/Microsoft\ Word/; ...+`
* seems like it should be easy to add, remove and list warp points
* everything should require typing few characters as possible :)
* it would be great to have full BASH completion support

Some future extensions could be based on some additional realizations:

* perhaps you might want to inspect a bookmarked folder without leaving your current place.
* maybe by inspecting we mean -- running a `find`, or `ls` or any other command for that matter

=== Notable Differences with original `wd`

* instead of `wd add!` use `wd add -f <point>` (or --force)

These features will be added shortly:

* for now `wd clean` is not supported
* for now history is not supported
* for now '-' is not supported

=== Future Feature Brainstorm

==== Simplify The CLI

Questionable value, but this sort of interface appear a bit more consistent.

Still I am not sure I want to type `wd -j proj` or `wd -a proj` instead of `wd proj` and `wd add proj`...

[,bash]
----
  wd -j/--jump   point
  wd -a/--add    point
  wd -r/--remove point
  wd -l/--ls     point
  wd -p/--path   point

  wd -L/--list
  wd -C/--clean
  wd -S/--scan           # report whether points exist on the file system
----

== Run Commands In A Warp Point

Pass an arbitrary command to execute, and return back to CWD.

[,bash]
----
  wd proj -x/--exec -- "command"
----


=== Networking

Can we go across SSH?

[,bash]
----
  wd add proj kig@remote.server.com:~/workspace/proj
  wd ls proj
  wd proj
----

This then establishes and SSH connection to the server and logs you into the shell. Should be pretty easy, I think :)

== Development

Fork the repo to your github username, and create a feature branch. Run `bundle install`.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To submit your change, create a new pull request, and ensure to provide tests for any new code.

== Adding New Commands

Just follow the pattern in the `lib/warp/dir/commands/` folder, copy and modify
one of the existing commands.  Command class name is used as an actual command.

Add a working rspec.
